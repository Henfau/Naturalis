# Naturalis

Artificial Life! What could be better?

The rules are simple:
A creature with a randomly generated neural network brain spawns, and loses energy over time. In order to sustain itself, it must eat.
If it runs out of energy, it dies, and if it gains enough of a surplus, it splits. The "offspring" has the same brain as its parent with
slight random weight changes.

The neural network implementation is made entirely "from scratch".
